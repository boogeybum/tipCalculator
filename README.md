## How-to use this code

- In a web browser, fill in the amount of the meal shown on the receipt. On the receipt it is normally the subtotal that includes the tax where applicable. Next fill in the tip percent amount using a whole number. If the tip is to be split among more than one person, update the "Number of People Splitting the Tip" field with the desired number. Any number less than 1 including negative numbers will default to one. Last, click on the "calculate" button to get the correct amounts for the total bill including tip and the tip amount each person is to pay.
